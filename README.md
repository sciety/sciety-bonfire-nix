# `sciety-bonfire-nix`

A Nix flake providing NixOS configurations for Sciety's Bonfire instance. It is based on [Bonfire's Nix flake](https://github.com/bonfire-networks/bonfire-nix).

To run this configuration on Digital Ocean's infrastructure, some additional changes are required. They can be found on the [`digitalocean`](https://github.com/sciety/sciety-bonfire-nix/tree/digitalocean) branch of this repository.
